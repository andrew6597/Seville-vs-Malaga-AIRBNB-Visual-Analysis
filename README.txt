Github is not able to plot the folium maps. In case you want to see the ploted maps and interact with them, it is better to use nbviewer.org to view the project: 
1. Copy and Paste this link https://nbviewer.org/github/andrew6597/Seville-vs-Malaga-AIRBNB-Visual-Analysis/blob/main/VA1_Marinis.ipynb
2. If that didn't work, go to nbviewer.org and paste https://github.com/andrew6597/Seville-vs-Malaga-AIRBNB-Visual-Analysis/blob/main/VA1_Marinis.ipynb on the search cell.

This should work!

Please comment if you found that intresting and feel free to judge and suggest more things on the project!
